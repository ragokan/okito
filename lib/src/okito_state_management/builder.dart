/// [OkitoBuilder] is the easiest way to track state changes and
/// re-render state on change.
///
/// Instead of having a stateful widget that re-renders on any change
/// which causes all the dependencies to re-render no matter if they
/// are changed or not, StatelessWidget with OkitoBuilder just re-renders
/// where did you use OkitoBuilder. If your widget don't need a dynamic
/// state, just don't put it inside builder. It won't re-built.
///
/// Example
///
/// ```dart
/// OkitoBuilder(
/// controller: counterController,
/// builder: () => Text('${counterController.count}',
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
class OkitoBuilder<T extends OkitoController> extends StatefulWidget {
  /// [controller] should be a class that extends or mixs [OkitoController].
  final T controller;

  /// If you have more than one [controller], you can create an array of
  /// [controller]s.
  final List<OkitoController> otherControllers;

  /// The [OkitoStorage] keys that you want to listen.
  ///
  /// You can provide as much as keys you want to listen and whenever
  /// a key changes, this widget will be rebuilt.
  final List<String> watchStorageKeys;

  /// If you want to watch any change in [OkitoStorage], make it true.
  final bool watchAllStorageKeys;

  /// Builder callback is called whenever your state changes.
  ///
  /// You have to return a Widget that you want to re-build on state changes.
  final BuilderCallback builder;

  /// Filter of builder
  final FilterCallback<T>? filter;

  /// Filter of builder
  Object? callFilter() => filter?.call(controller);

  /// If you set this to true, whenever the builder disposes or activates
  /// the *initState* and *dispose* functions will be called for all the
  /// [otherControllers]. Be careful when using it.
  final bool activateLifecycleForOtherControllers;

  /// OkitoBuilder is the way to use OkitoController.
  ///
  /// Its main advantage is having a builder that just re-renders itself on
  /// state change which means that your other widgets that doesn't depend
  /// on your state won't re-build on update.
  ///
  /// Usage is simple, just create an [OkitoController] just like it is declared
  /// in its documentation, then show that controller when you call the builder.
  ///
  /// Example
  ///
  ///```dart
  /// OkitoBuilder(
  ///        controller: counterController,
  ///        builder: () => Text('Current count is ${counterController.count}'),
  ///        ),
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Example With Multiple Controllers
  ///
  ///```dart
  /// OkitoBuilder(
  ///        controller: counterController,
  ///        otherControllers: [ageController, userController /* and other controllers */],
  ///        builder: () => Text('Current count is ${counterController.count}'),
  ///        ),
